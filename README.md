What is Hadoop?

Hadoop is an open-source Apache project that allows creation of parallel processing applications on large data sets, distributed across networked nodes. It is composed of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFSâ„¢) that handles scalability and redundancy of data across nodes, and Hadoop YARN, a framework for job scheduling that executes data processing tasks on all nodes.
